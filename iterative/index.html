				<h2>Startup Context</h2>
				<p>
					Kopa is the marketplace for <b>monthly rentals and compatible housemates</b>, and the company’s mission is to
					enable people to browse rentals, find roommates, and book and pay for spaces in a one-stop-shop. Currently the
					start-up is still in operation, and that’s why we believe a redesign might bring some real-world impact to
					this company.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our favourite quote from the company founder and CEO is: “We believe that exploration and community make
					people whole. Kopa exists to inspire people to get out of their comfort zones, to form lasting relationships,
					and to live more fulfilled lives.”

				<h2>Interactive Hi-Fi Mockup Critique</h2>
				<p>
					During our critique session, we had the opportunity to receive feedback from not only fellow peers but also an
					industry expert, Gifford Cheung, who is a Sr. UX Researcher @Nintendo (and ex-classmate of Jeff!). Here are
					highlights of the feedback received, and how we addressed them:
				</p>
				<h4>General Feedback</h4>
				<p>
					Reviewers generally liked our UI (e.g. color palette) and design hierarchy for the 3 pages (sign-up, browse
					rentals, find roommates). Particularly, they thought the layouts of the sign-up and find roommates pages were
					fun and innovative.
				</p>
				<h4>Finding Roommates</h4>
				<div class="column-list">
					<div class="column">
						<p class="suggestion">
							<b>Suggestion #1</b>: The page is a bit overwhelming without any guidance; clarification about its
							structure/algorithm would be helpful.
						</p>
						<p class="changed">
							<b>What we changed</b>: Added welcome text briefly explaining our matching algorithm and categories. This
							also added some white space for improved hierarchy.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<p class="suggestion">
							<b>Suggestion #2</b>: At first, it is unclear that users can scroll horizontally in addition to the
							traditional vertical scroll.
						</p>
						<p class="changed">
							<b>What we changed</b>: Added arrows on the right end of each category to indicate the ability to scroll
							horizontally.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Browsing Rentals</h4>
				<div class="column-list">
					<div class="column">
						<p class="suggestion">
							<b>Suggestion #1</b>: Reviewers thought our ‘Bookmarked’ box at the bottom right was an important
							component but wasn’t prominent enough.
						</p>
						<p class="changed">
							<b>What we changed</b>: Made the ‘Bookmarked’ box larger, expandible/collapsible, and added a dark header
							section that pops out from the map more. We also added a shortcut to bookmarked items in the header, so it
							is accessible at all times.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<p class="suggestion">
							<b>Suggestion & Change</b>: Add placeholder text for area search so users know what kinds of information
							they can input
						</p>
					</div>

				<h2>STORYBOARDING</h2>
				<h4>A Walkthrough of Jamie's Boba Ordering Experience</h4>
				<img class="image" src="media/storyboard.png" alt="storymap">
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>From Jamie’s journey, we see ordering and drinking boba is most often the backdrop of a socially-driven
					activity. This means that it is important for the boba self-ordering interface to be quick & seamless to
					navigate because it is just a vehicle for the more important objective of spending time with friends.</p>
