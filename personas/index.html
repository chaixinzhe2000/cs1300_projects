	<div class="heading">Part I: Preparation</div>
	<div class="subheading">1) Select an accessible interface in public</div>
	<div class="text">
		Ever since I received my driver’s license last year, the gas station is a place I’d frequent from time to time.
		Although there are many different gas station chains (Shell, bp, Stop & Shop, Mobil, etc.), I observed that the
		interface of the gas pump in those different gas stations is mostly the same, and I remembered that adding gas
		wasn’t the most intuitive experience for first-timers. That’s why I decided to choose the gas pump interface as my
		public interface to study.
	</div>
	<div class="subheading">2) Making a sketch of the gas pump interface</div>
	<div class="text">
		<b>Sketch of a common gas pump interface</b></br>
		Purpose: handle payment, enable fuel grade selection, and display price information to the user
		<img src="sketch.png" width="400">
		<div>
			<b>A</b>: Information panel, displaying price and storage metrics</br>
			<b>B</b>: Touch-sensitive button, allowing users to control the display</br>
			<b>C</b>: Credit card reader, reading credit card information</br>
			<b>D</b>: PIN pad, handling number inputs</br>
			<b>E</b>: LCD display, displaying per gallon price for each fuel grade</br>
			<b>F</b>: Fuel grade button, allowing users to choose fuel grade</br>
		</div>

	<div class="heading">Part II: Recording Observations</div>
	<div class="subheading">1) Key Observations</div>
	<div class="text">
		Overall, most users could use the gas pump interface to add fuel to their vehicle. These are some of the key
		characteristics I observed:
		<ul>
			<li>Half of the user initiates the transaction by directly inserting their credit card, while the other half uses
				the LED screen to initiate transactions</li>
			<li>There is no clear way to terminate the transaction, and one user had to go to another pump to continue the
				transaction</li>
			<li>The interface requires users to look down to select the fuel grade, and the user often hesitates on which fuel
				to choose as they are cautious not to choose the wrong grade</li>
			<li>Very few users would wait to receive the paper receipt</li>
			<li>The button on the side of the LED screen does not produce any touch response, and sometimes the user would
				click
				the button multiple times</li>
			<li>During fueling, users usually put their attention to Part A in the sketch, to track the current price and
				volume
			</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="subheading">2) User Research Questions</div>
		<ol>
			<li>Do you feel that the gas pump interface was easy-to-use, and the affordance of the side buttons is natural?
			</li>
			<li>How would you rate your experience on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best)?</li>
			<li>Where does your attention stay when you are fueling?</li>
			<li>How often do you go to the gas station?</li>
			<li>If you have been to different gas stations, do you think there is a learning curve between different pumps?
			</li>
			<li>Is there any new feature you would like to see on a new gas pump?</li>
			<li>Have you encountered any difficulties during the fueling process?</li>
			<li>Are you happy with the physical feedback of your commands on buttons and/or fuel-grade selectors?</li>
			<li>Is there anything else you would like to add?</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="subheading">3) Summarized Responses</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Users generally feel the pump is easy-to-use, but the experience does have room for improvement - on a scale
				of
				1-10, users surveyed gave an average rating of 7.2.</li>
			<li>43% of the users had previous experience pressing the wrong button on the gas pump and were unable to cancel
				the
				transaction</li>
			<li>Most people reported that there is no learning curve between gas pumps of different brands</li>
			<li>Users were not satisfied with the control feedback of the side buttons - there was a short beep after each
				touch, but there was no physical feedback. Hearing-impaired users might receive no feedback at all.</li>
			<li>Almost all users focus on the price LCD display (Part A) during the fuelling process</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="heading">Part III: Personas</div>
	<img src="alex.png" width="550" style="margin-bottom: 0">
	<div class="text"><b>“Geeky” Alex</b> is a student who commutes in his car. He depends on financial support from his
		parents and he embraces all kinds of new technologies.

		Right now, his main concern is that the interface is irresponsive and the gas pump does not accept touchless
		payment. Since the gas station I visited is near Brown University, there are a lot of students who use their
		service.</div>

	<img src="susan.png" width="550" style="margin-bottom: 0">
	<div class="text"><b>“Thoughtful” Susan</b> is a married mother with 2 kids. She cares a lot about hygiene and she is
		always thinking about her family. She doesn’t mind paying extra for better gas, but she is rather impatient to wait
		to fuel up the big tank in her F-150.

		Right now, her concern is that interface does not provide too much security and the gas pump does not provide an
		estimate of the overall progress of fueling. I have encountered many middle-aged users who drive big cars, and they
		usually bring their families around in the car.
